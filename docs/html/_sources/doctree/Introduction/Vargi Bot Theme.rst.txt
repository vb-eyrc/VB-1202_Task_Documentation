   A UR5 by Universal Robots, the robotic arm used in this task.

The current edition of the e-Yantra Robotics Competition features a theme called ‘Vargi-Bots’. Vargi is taken from a Sanskrit word, Vargikaran (वर्गीकरण) which means to separate objects based on their category.

The arena is an automated warehouse setting where essential packages are required to be sent out to different parts of a city. As the requirements are sent to the warehouse, one robotic arm will identify the packages from a shelf and place them on a conveyor belt and the other robotic arm at the end of the conveyor belt will pick these objects from the conveyor and place them into bins. Each bin represents a destination for the package. As the packages are sent out from the warehouse there will also be alerts sent to the user via email notifying them about the package being shipped from the warehouse.

The packages to be delivered have their own priorities. Packages having a higher priority are intended for a natural disaster or a pandemic situation. Other packages with lower priorities are for general purposes. In this theme, the participants have to design their own conductor (controller) for their warehouse to make smart decisions in order to deliver high priority packages as quickly as possible.
